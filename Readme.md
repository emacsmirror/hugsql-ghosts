*(It'll look better with your color theme of course.)*

## Installation

### MELPA
As hugsql-ghosts is available via [MELPA](https://melpa.org/), you can install it via:

<kbd>M-x</kbd> `package-install` <kbd>RET</kbd> `hugsql-ghosts` <kbd>RET</kbd>


### Manual
Should you wish to install it manually, you should install the
following packages:

 - <a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">s.el</a>
 - <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a>
 - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a>

Then put hugsql-ghosts.el in your elisp path and require it in your .emacs:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'hugsql-ghosts)
```

### Hook
In either case, add it to the [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) mode hook:

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook 'hugsql-ghosts-install-hook)
```

Ghosts should now appear in all CIDER buffers which have either `(hugsql/def-db-fns "path/to/your/queries.sql")` or `(hugsql/def-sqlvec-fns "path/to/your/queries.sql")`.
Please note that this only works if you've required `hugsql.core` as `hugsql` in your clojure source. Furthermore, changes in sql are only reflected after you reload your CIDER buffer (C-c C-k).

**Hugsql-ghosts needs an active cider connection to work as the query parsing is done by the hugsql library itself via cider.**


## Usage / Configuration

If you don't want the function doc strings to be displayed you can set `hugsql-ghosts-show-descriptions` to `nil`.
By default the doc strings will be displayed on the same line as the `defun`, if you don't like that or don't have enough horizontal screen real-estate, you can set `hugsql-ghosts-newline-before-docstrings` to `t`.

The display of ghosts can be triggered manually by calling `hugsql-ghosts-display-query-ghosts`, to get rid of them simply call `hugsql-ghosts-remove-overlays`.

Finally, you can customize the face `hugsql-ghosts-defn` to adapt the overlay appearance to your liking.
